#CNN:Convolution Neural Network
In machine learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN or ConvNet) are complex feed forward neural networks. CNNs are used for image classification and recognition because of its high accuracy. It was proposed by computer scientist Yann LeCun in the late 90s, when he was inspired from the human visual perception of recognizing things. The CNN follows a hierarchical model which works on building a network, like a funnel, and finally gives out a fully-connected layer where all the neurons are connected to each other and the output is processed.
